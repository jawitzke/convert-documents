<p><em>“I believe that I have come to my ultimate conclusion that I am ready, so I might as well fare in the joys of this terribly bleak and<br />tedious day for it is the same as the last.”</em> <strong>Mr. Hobson</strong> had a horrific problem of talking to himself, but he is a man of much<br />imagination, and even though he would never admit it in order to maintain the negligible pride that remained, he believes he is his best<br />form of entertainment. <strong>Mr. Hobson</strong> a man of everything and a boy of nothing, perfectly matched the town at which he resides. A gilded<br />man who always presents a feeble smile in public, always well mannered and pleasant, but no one can be so easily represented as a visual.<br />After Mrs. Hobson had been diagnosed his veins thickened with booze. To <strong>Mr. Hobson</strong>, she was the smell before rain, and he was the dark<br />clouds coming to meet the warm summer drizzle.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Hobson</strong> after enduring the dreadful traffic that consistently persists day by day arrived back at his cold cottage of a home.<br />Atticus, <strong>Mr. Hobson’s</strong> Siberian husky that was as faithful as waves passing, and had eyes to match the ocean with a grey coat that accurately represents the storm that was brewing outside. Atticus proceeded to follow <strong>Mr. Hobson</strong> as he grabbed a cup of water and a<br />glass of scotch before he grabbed and lifted up the picture of him and Mrs. Hobson that had been taken nearly a decade ago. <strong>Mr. Hobson</strong> gazed in wariness at their innocent and seemingly happy faces that were so utterly filled with love. He squinted back into his thoughts<br />reflecting on how his time could have been different on this earth.</p>
<p>To <strong>Mr. Hobson</strong>, this one single picture seemed to provoke more wounding nostalgia than most men could handle in a lifetime, yet he<br />stood there still as a brick, emotionless from the outside. Until he gives in and collapses on the couch, so he can reach for the scotch;<br />however, as soon as he took a sip he spat out the liquor because nothing warm deserved to be in that house, and he decided he wanted to be<br />sober for smell of the storm coming. A tear now started to linger around <strong>Mr. Hobson’</strong>s eye, but with confidence and determination he<br />swallowed his sadness and rose out of the couch. He put the picture back on the dark crisp granite counters. Before walking away <strong>Mr.<br />Hobson</strong> tenderly rubbed the frame with his hand as if it were Mrs. Hobson head. This entire time Atticus had been staring up at <strong>Mr.<br />Hobson</strong> with as much curiosity that a canine could possibly show, but <strong>Mr. Hobson</strong> mistakenly thought this expression was one of hunger<br />and gazed over at the dog food bowl.</p>
<p>Never letting his gaze leave the floor, <strong>Mr. Hobson</strong> saunters while dragging his feet over to the pantry and grabbed the standard<br />serving for Atticus, but before he sets the food in the bowl he changed his mind and gives Atticus enough food to last about five days.<br /><em>“Surely, five days will be enough”</em> <strong>Mr. Hobson</strong> mumbled to himself. <em>“Surely…”</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Hobson</strong> without hesitation leaned down and embraced Atticus in a wholehearted hug before getting up and gentle petting every hair<br />on his back between in his gently shaking fingers. <strong>Mr. Hobson</strong> propped open the back door with a cinder block that had been lying<br />around for years. Atticus continue to gaze into <strong>Mr. Hobson’s</strong> face now drawing his attention causing him to realize that the dog knew.</p>
<p><em>“Please buddy, do not look at me like that…. Be a good boy for me.”</em> <strong>Mr. Hobson</strong> was never the best at goodbyes. He thought that they<br />were to cliché and belonged in a Shakespeare play. <strong>Mr. Hobson</strong> always had more of a Bukowski philosophy on farewells. They should not<br />happen.</p>
<p>No longer dragging his feet he made his way over to the dinning room and hauled a chair across the deep red mahogany wood floors that where noticeably the most prestigious part of <strong>Mr. Hobson’s</strong> house. He set the chair in the living room. The storm had finally reached<br />the cottage and the aroma of rain began to linger around his nose. Surprisingly, the smell had only enhanced his confidence and <strong>Mr.<br />Hobson</strong> climbed up the chair step by step. Looking around the room he saw every little artifact of the house that reminded him of Mrs.<br />Hobson. The Dali print that hung about their fireplace that seemed to provide the perfect juxtaposition that Salvador himself could only<br />dream of because the rest of the room was filled with black and brown, but that painting alone was enough to brighten up the room.</p>
<p>Thunder then cracked throughout <strong>Mr. Hobson’s</strong> head, removing him from the trance that the painting seemed to have put him under. <strong>Mr.<br />Hobson</strong> then swallowed deeply and continued the task at hand feeling every bristle around his neck. It had never dawned on him that the<br />bristles would be so itchy, and annoying, but yet they seemed to bring about a hint of satisfaction to him. <strong>Mr. Hobson</strong> felt the loose<br />strands more intensely as he pulled down tighter. He glanced over at Atticus who seemed to nod his head in approval causing <strong>Mr. Hobson</strong><br />to nod in agreement as if to let Atticus now it will all be fine.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Hobson</strong> then peered over at the picture one last time, thinking of Mrs. Hobson’s intoxicating laugh,</p>
<p>##### and #### took ### his ## leap ## of # faith.</p>
<p>##### The End.</p>
